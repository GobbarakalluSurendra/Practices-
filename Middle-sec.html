    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
        Hello, my name is <b>Gobbarakallu Surendra</b>. I am a 
        <b>Computer Science (Data Science)</b> student in my 3rd year of engineering.  
        My goal is to become a <b>Full Stack Developer</b> who can design and 
        build complete websites and applications from start to finish.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am passionate about <b>web development</b> because I enjoy turning 
        complex coding problems into <b>simple and useful solutions</b>. 
        I started my journey with <b>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</b>, and 
        later explored <b>ReactJS</b> for creating interactive web pages.  
        I also have a strong interest in <b>Data Science</b>, which helps me 
        understand how data can improve user experiences.
    </p>

    <p>
        During my <b>internship as a Web Developer</b>, I worked on real-world projects 
        and learned the importance of writing clean code, teamwork, and meeting deadlines.  
        One of my favorite projects was an <b>e-commerce website</b> where I built features 
        like product listings, a shopping cart, and a secure payment option.  
        This project was appreciated for being <b>fast and easy to use</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
        I believe success comes from <b>teamwork and continuous learning</b>. 
        I always try to collaborate with others, share ideas, and improve myself 
        by learning new technologies. üåç
    </p>

    <p>
        Apart from technical skills, I am also good at <b>communication</b>.  
        I can speak <b>Telugu and English</b> fluently, and I also know 
        <b>Hindi and Kannada</b>. This helps me connect with people from different places 
        and work better in teams.
    </p>

    <p>
        My aim is to grow as a <b>skilled Full Stack Developer</b> and 
        work on projects that make a positive impact on people‚Äôs lives.
